# About
This is a collection of scripts, configuration files and assets that I want pretty much everywhere.

Hopefully a never-ending work in progress.

## Security
Sensitive files or files that are useless for anybody but me are encrypted and prepended with encrypted_MEO (for My Eyes Only).

This repo is designed so that `$HOME` itself is the git repo. To prevent accidentally tracking sensitive files, `.gitignore` ignores everything by default (`*`) and individual files and directories are allowlisted explicitly.
